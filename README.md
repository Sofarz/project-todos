# Project Todos
This is a project built during the Technigo Bootcamp. The project consisted in building a Todo-app to practise:
- How to structure a redux store
- How to write reducers and actions
- How to interact with the store using selectors or by dispatching actions. 

## The problem
I started off by thinking about what kind of structure I wanted in my todo app - what components I would need, what styling method I would go for and what my reducer should contain. 
By reading about similar projects, watching tutorials and looking at redux own webpage I started building my application and getting the logic working. 
However, for each lecture we had during the week I ended up modifying my code inside the reducers to change from mutable to immutable approach and simply to try to go for what is considered "best practise".
I also chose to use styled components for most of my application for practise. 

Compared to previous projects I also started to use new packages from material.ui, uniqid and date fns.

If I had more time I would have wanted to practise on local storage as well as adding more features to the app.
